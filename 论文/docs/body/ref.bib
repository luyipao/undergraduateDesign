  abstract  = {In this paper we further explore a class of high order TVD (total variation diminishing) Runge-Kutta time discretization initialized in a paper by Shu and Osher, suitable for solving hyperbolic conservation laws with stable spatial discretizations. We illustrate with numerical examples that non-TVD but linearly stable Runge-Kutta time discretization can generate oscillations even for TVD (total variation diminishing) spatial discretization, verifying the claim that TVD Runge-Kutta methods are important for such applications. We then explore the issue of optimal TVD Runge-Kutta methods for second, third and fourth order, and for low storage Runge-Kutta methods.},
